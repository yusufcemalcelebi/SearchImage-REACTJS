## Image Search App with React.js

In this example project, I developed an front-end application on React.js with Unsplash API
User can search images with keywords on specific Collections. Collections added as hardcoded. (eg. Animals, Halloween)

There are some package dependencies. These are:
- "react-router-dom"
- "google-maps-react"

Feel free to contact me for any improvements!
